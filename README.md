# fns-examples

This is a collection of example CNDI Function implementations. The functions are
built using Deno by leveraging the
[Supabase Edge Runtime](https://github.com/supabase/edge-runtime).

To get started deploying your own self-hosted functions runtime, checkout
[CNDI](https://cndi.run/gh?utm_id=) and our
[fns Template](https://cndi.run/gh?utm_content=gh_readme_link_polyseam_fns&utm_campaign=fns_readme&utm_source=github.com/polyseam/fns&utm_medium=repo&utm_id=5102)
